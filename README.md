📌 Project Overview

This project predicts taxi trip fares based on ride details such as pickup/dropoff coordinates, time of day, distance, and other engineered features.
It uses Machine Learning models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Linear Regression, etc.) to estimate fares and provides a Streamlit web app for user interaction.

⚙️ Features

📊 Data Preprocessing: Cleaning missing values, feature engineering (distance, time, day/night flag).

🤖 Modeling: Trained with multiple regression algorithms (Random Forest, GradientBoosting, Ridge/Lasso, etc.).

🔍 Feature Importance: Understand which features most influence trip fare.

🌐 Streamlit App: Enter trip details (pickup, dropoff, time) → Get predicted fare instantly.

📈 Evaluation Metrics: R², RMSE, MAE for performance tracking.
